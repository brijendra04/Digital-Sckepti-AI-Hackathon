###Digital Skeptic AI
Tagline: Empowering Critical Thinking in an Age of Information Overload.

Premise
In today's digital world, we are constantly exposed to a firehose of information. The essential task of vetting every article for bias, spin, or logical fallacies is mentally exhausting, making it easy to fall for misinformation.

This project, created for the "Freedom from Mundane: AI for a Smarter Life" hackathon, is a tool that acts as a critical thinking partner. It automates the initial analysis of online news articles, freeing up our mental energy to make our own informed judgments. It does not label content as "true" or "false," but instead highlights claims, analyzes language, and arms the reader with the right questions to ask.

‚ú® Features
Article Content Extraction: Fetches the full text content from any news article URL.

Core Claim Summarization: Uses Generative AI to identify and list the 3-5 main factual claims made in the article.

Language & Tone Analysis: Analyzes the author's language to detect neutrality, emotional charging, or persuasive intent.

Red Flag Detection: Automatically identifies signs of potential bias or poor reporting, such as the use of loaded terminology, reliance on anonymous sources, or a lack of cited data.

Generates Verification Questions: Provides a list of specific, insightful questions to guide the reader in their own verification process.

Key Entity Recognition: A "stand-out" feature that identifies key people, organizations, and locations mentioned and suggests what a reader should investigate about them.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

AI Model: Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash-latest)

Libraries:

google-generativeai: For interacting with the Gemini API.

requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch article URLs.

beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML and extracting clean article text.

python-dotenv: For securely managing the API key.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher

A Google Gemini API Key. You can obtain one from Google AI Studio.

2. Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/brijendra04/Digital-Sckepti-AI-Hackathon.git
cd digital-skeptic-ai

Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file containing the libraries listed in the Tech Stack section).

3. Environment Setup
Create a file named .env in the root of your project directory. Add your Gemini API key to this file:

GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

4. Running the Program
Execute the main script from your terminal:

python main.py

The program will prompt you to enter the URL of the news article you wish to analyze. The final report will be printed to the console and saved as a Markdown (.md) file in the project directory.

üìù Example Output
Here is a sample of the "Critical Analysis Report" generated by the tool.

# Critical Analysis Report for: [Article Title]

### Core Claims
* Claim 1...
* Claim 2...
* Claim 3...

### Language & Tone Analysis
The language in this article is highly persuasive and uses emotionally charged words like 'disastrous' and 'unprecedented' to frame the narrative.

### Potential Red Flags
* The article heavily relies on a single anonymous 'insider' for its most significant claims.
* Statistical data is mentioned but no link to the source study is provided.
* Alternative explanations for the event are mentioned but immediately dismissed without exploration.

### Verification Questions
1.  Can I find other independent reports from reputable sources that corroborate the claims made by the 'insider'?
2.  Who funded the organization that published this article, and do they have a known political or commercial agenda?
3.  What do experts with opposing views say about this topic?

### Key Entities to Investigate
* **[Person's Name]**: Investigate their professional background and any known affiliations.
* **The XYZ Institute**: Look into the funding sources and past publications of this organization.

‚ö†Ô∏è A Note on Web Scraping
Some websites employ measures to block automated scraping. While the script uses a standard User-Agent to minimize this, it may not work on all sites. As per the hackathon guidelines, if a specific URL is blocked, an acceptable alternative is to save the article's text to a local file and modify the script to read from that file.
